    <h1 style="color: #06b6d4">My Goa Trip</h1>

        <P> I went to Goa along with my friend on Feb 2022 and I was  fortunate enough to spend more than a week in Goa .Goa is  smallest city of  western India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea,Goa is famous for its beaches,night-life , water sports and historical church. 
           Famous beaches to visit in Goa are :
            Baga beach 🏖️
            Morjim 🏖️
            Vagator 🏖️ 
            Candolim 🏖️
            Anjuna 🏖️
            among all the beaches Baga beach is top most crowded beach in Goa.
            In Goa there are two opposite areas which is south Goa and north Goa.
            Where North Goa is famous for night-life, clubbing etc whereas South Goa offers you a heady mix of exotic and sandy beaches, churches and temples rich in history, glimpses into Portuguese culture, mind-blowing seafood.
            We had explored each and everything thing in Goa like  water sports,night -life,beach parties  and casinos.
            In Goa,Panjim is also very great place to visit it have attractive bridge decorated with lights and floating casinos the view is very soothing and gives you happy vibes.
            We had created lots of good and bad memories and,I wish to visit again.Everyone should visit Goa once in there life.
            And I had read somewhere Goa is all about.
